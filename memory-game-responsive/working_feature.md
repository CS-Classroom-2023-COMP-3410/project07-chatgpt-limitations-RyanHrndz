# Feature Implementation Summary

## Changes Attempted:
- Attempted to style the **turn indicator** and **score tracking** in the `.player-info` section.
- Tried applying **background colors and font styles** to match the jungle theme.
- Aimed to ensure the UI updates dynamically when a playerâ€™s turn or score changes.

## Issues Encountered:
- The **turn indicator (`turnIndicator`)** was not updating correctly when switching turns.
- Player scores (`player1Score`, `player2Score`) **did not display properly** after matches.
- CSS styles were applied, but **not correctly reflected in the game layout**.
- Some elements did **not align properly** within the `.player-info` section.

## Next Steps:
- Debug why the **turn indicator does not update dynamically**.
- Ensure that score updates **trigger correctly** when matches are found.
- Adjust the CSS to ensure consistent styling and proper layout alignment.
- Run **further tests** to verify the UI updates in real-time.

**The feature is not fully functional yet. Further debugging and testing are needed.**
